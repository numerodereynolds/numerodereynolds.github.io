	<!-- The previous header must exist to tell Jekyll to read this file. It says to Jekyll to use the file "default.html" from "_layout" folder. It says as well that the title that I want to appear on this page is "número de Reynolds" (it goes to "{{ page.title }}" on the default.html file and replaces it to anything that comes after "title: " (in this case "número de Reynolds"). -->
	
	<!-- Anything that comes after this comment will be placed where it says "{{ content }}" on the _layout/default.html file.-->
