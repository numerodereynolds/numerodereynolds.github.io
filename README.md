In this file, I will explain how this project is organized:

  - .gitignore : This file says to git to ignore '_site' directory that Jekyll will generate each time it is committed. Because this directory and all the files inside are written each time they are committed, I do not want this directory under version control.
  
  - .config.yml : This file tells Jekyll the name of my site ("n√∫mero de Reynolds") and the version of Markdown I'm using ("karmdown").
